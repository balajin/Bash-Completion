Bash-Completion
===============

Bash completion scripts for common utilities

To use these scripts, you have to install bash-completion

If you are using Ubuntu run ( Only if its not already installed )

sudo apt-get install bash-completion

For osx with homebrew, run

brew install bash-completion

Depending upon your system, you need to add the scripts in different locations

In Ubuntu I have added the scripts in 

/etc/bash_completion.d/

In osx having installed completion in homebrew, the completion scripts are found in

/usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d/
